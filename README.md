# LMS-2-Discord

> Notify for new items in moodle based lms


For some reasons the LMS used in my university not exposing api for students. So I had to scrap everything and compare them manually to get data about newly added content. Script runs 4 times per day (6hour-interval). So notifications isn't real time
Script is currently hosted in heroku.
